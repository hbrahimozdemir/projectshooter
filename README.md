Shooter Game Project is a mini third-person shooter (TPS) game developed within one week, featuring a single level with a clear objective: retrieve a hidden project document to complete the mission.

Key mechanics include:

Dynamic Endings: Players achieve a good ending by escaping with the document or a bad ending if they escape without it.
Stealth and AI Interactions: Security cameras trigger alarms upon detecting the player, summoning enemy AI to the player's last known position. AI returns to its starting position if the player is not found; otherwise, it engages in combat.
Player Tools: Players can disable cameras via an interactive panel within the map.
